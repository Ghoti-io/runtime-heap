# Fail if a public header carries no stability label, or the wrong one.
#
# AD-14: every public header says whether it is `stable` (frozen at the major
# version once released) or `free` (a consumer requires the exact version it
# was built against). The label is a Doxygen tag in the header's @file block:
#
#     @stability stable
#
# This library's whole public surface is the C embedding API of the collector
# (AD-14, AD-11), so every header is `stable`, with one exception: relocate.h
# exists only in a build made with RELOCATE=yes (a test-only mode that is not
# part of the API a consumer can count on), so it is `free`, and is required to
# be. There is no a/ or b/ split to
# choose a label by directory, as in runtime-core: the headers are flat, and a
# `free` one here would quietly promise less than the spine says. A header
# that needs the other label is a decision to take on purpose, and this gate
# is where it would be noticed.
#
# Usage: check-labels.sh <root>
#   <root> holds include/ghoti.io/runtime-heap/. The self-test runs this same
#   script against tests/gates fixtures.
#
# Fails on an empty population: no headers found means the gate measured
# nothing, and a gate that measures nothing reports success.
