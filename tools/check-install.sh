# Prove that what `make install` leaves behind is usable by a consumer that
# knows nothing about this source tree.
#
# Everything else this project checks is checked in-tree, against headers in
# include/ and a library in build/, reached by paths the Makefile already
# knows. A consumer reaches none of those: it asks pkg-config for a module
# name, compiles against whatever -I it is handed, and links against whatever
# -L and -l it is handed. That is a different code path, and CONVENTIONS.md
# section 1 records three defects that lived in it while every in-tree build
# stayed green - a .pc that emitted "-I <path>", which pkg-config splits into
# two arguments; one that omitted a "/" and named a directory that does not
# exist; and six of seven that emitted an empty Version:, because VERSION was
# substituted into the template but defined in only one Makefile.
#
# So each check below is named for the defect it would have caught, and the
# last one is the only check that proves the whole path at once: compile a
# program that includes only the installed umbrella header, link it with only
# the flags pkg-config gives, and run it.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/check-install.sh <prefix> [module-name]
#
# The module name defaults to ghoti.io-runtime-heap-0, which is what an ordinary
# build of 0.x installs; pass it explicitly for a build that overrode BRANCH.
